# Project-4-Netflix-Movies-and-TV-shows-clustering
This project aims to analyze a dataset comprising TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019, sourced from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. Notably, a report from 2018 revealed a significant shift in Netflix's content landscape. While the number of movies on the platform had decreased by over 2,000 titles since 2010, the number of TV shows had nearly tripled during the same period. The project's objectives include conducting exploratory data analysis, discerning the distribution of content types across various countries, investigating whether Netflix's focus has shifted towards TV shows, and exploring content clustering using text-based features.Â¶
